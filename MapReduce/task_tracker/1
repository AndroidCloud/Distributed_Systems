BENGALURU:  Hundreds of miles away from the political tempest tossing his Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, dressed in white kurta-pyjama, is doing yoga and breathing exercises and is sticking to a very strict diet on a health farm outside Bengaluru.

The AAP chief made headlines yesterday and in morning papers today after an ex-party colleague made public the recording of what he alleged was a phone conversation between him and Mr Kejriwal about securing the support of Congress MLAs last year.

"Horsetrading," alleged political rivals. A senior leader of his party Anjali Damani announced she was quitting. Other leaders had to rush out in defence of the party and Mr Kejriwal; AAP's Ashish Khetan said it was about "political realignment, not horsetrading."
